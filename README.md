# SCSS Base Setup

This repository provides a foundational SCSS (Sass) architecture for scalable and maintainable front-end projects. It includes a structured set of folders and files for organizing design tokens, themes, layout rules, and vendor styles. The goal is to help teams quickly bootstrap new projects with a clear separation of concerns, reusable patterns, and best practices for writing modular and consistent SCSS code.

> **Note:** This SCSS architecture was created with reference and inspiration from [Sass Guidelines by Hugo Giraudel](https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture). The structure and best practices outlined here are heavily influenced by the recommendations in that resource.
